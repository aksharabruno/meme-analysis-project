🧪🗃️","Meme. Painting of a medieval abbot. He's standing and holding a little red book, which is open in his hand. He has a long white beard, and the hair on the side of his head sweeps over his ears like the tide sweeps over a sandbar. He is bald, and there is a fine patina of light on dancing across his head. He is wearing a dark grey robe, with the hood thrown back, and next to him is the staff of his office. Behind is head is a yellow 
halo, so you know he's esp. holy.

He is looking down towards the book, but not actually at it. It looks like he was reading, but got distracted by something on the floor a little in front of him. His expression is calm, so it's not anything wild like a group of rabbits ritualistically sacrificing a sparrow. More like he's seen a piece of cheese, and the abbot can't quite recall when last he had cheese. Later, idly, he'll pick it up and realize that it's lint from his socks.

His name is even less certain, but we'll call him Yedward. He is wearing a long orange shirt, and is paddling his boat across a body of blue water. There are clouds int eh background. Yedward might have been wearing a hat at some point, but if he was, the fish has eaten it. He seems very concerned, and you would too. That fish is no joke.

The fish has it's jaws around Yedward's head, and is arching its back so far that its tail will soon touch the top of its head. It's fins are thrust out, and it looks very graceful.

It's unfair to name the man but not the fish, so we'll call her Merwena. She was raised on tales of Jonah & Moby Dick, & longs to be like her literary heroes. She's going to eat this man if it takes all day. He can't paddle forever. Especially with a hole in his head.

🗃️🧪","Meme. Medieval drawing of a cooper, putting the lid on a barrel with a hammer, while surrounded by other barrels. The man -- we'll call him Ædwallow-- is wearing a pink shirt and blue leggings, as if he's planning on going to gender reveal party later and he wants to cover all his bases. He's wearing a somewhat shapeless red hat that might -- or might not -- keep his ears warm. He has a white apron tied around his waist.

He is clean-shaven, and his face looks young. His expression is terribly intense, and it doesn't take much imagination to believe that he is sealing his rival in this barrel. Perhaps this was a man named Flord whom Ædwallow had called a friend in his youth, until he had ran off with Ædwallow's mother to live a life of crime together as petty toast thieves in Malta. Ævence spent years tracking them down, & now's he's caught them and stuffed them in barrels to ship back home, for reasons only he knows.

🗃️🧪","Meme. Still from the movie ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" showing Indiana Jones staring at a golden idol. This is from the early part of the film. His hat is in fine shape, and he's stroking his chin as he ponders his next move. He's about to replace the idol with a bag of sand, only to have shit get real, real fast. Behind him is a jungle temple, replete with surprisingly effective and deadly traps. The effectiveness and durability of these traps suggests that a unionized crew did the work.

The idol is facing away from you, and you can see that its hair is combed straight down its head. It does not know it, but it's destined for a future in an American museum. Later on, a diverse band of intrepid thieves with unique character traits will try to steal it from the museum in a totally separate movie that's part ""Topkapi"" and part ""Money Train.""

In 1250 the abbot of Tupeholm sued the nuns Stykeswald. The nuns owed the abbot a yearly rent of 6 sticks of eels, but hadn't paid for 3 years!

That's 450 eels, folks. Scandalous!

The nuns agreed to pay a fine, and life went on.
🗃️🧪","Meme. Medieval painting of a nun, her head bowed and her hands clasped in front of her. There is something of a halo around her head. She is cutting her eyes towards you, and her eyebrows seem sculpted to perfection. Her lips are pursed, and her nose is so straight that you could use it for a ruler. Presumably you have interrupted her in the middle of prayer. Your first impression is that she is meant to look holy.

But, on further examination, this feels...off. Her expression is not terribly reverent. This nun (we'll call her Sister Immolate) looks coy, and cunning. Her hands, which you first took to be clasped in prayer, appear to be arched in a Mr. Burns ""excellent"" pose, and the lift of her eyebrows suggests that she knows things that you don't.

And not just things. A specific THING. And you'll not be in the dark for long. You've walked right into Sister Immolate's trap, like a hiker to a mountain lion's lair. Good luck.

He has a long white beard, and the hair on the side of his head sweeps over his ears like the tide sweeps over a sandbar. He is bald, and there is a fine patina of light on dancing across his head. He is wearing a dark grey robe, with the hood thrown back, and next to him is the staff of his office. Behind is head is a yellow halo, so you know he's esp. holy.

He is looking down towards the book, but not actually at it. It looks like he was reading, but got distracted by something on the floor a little in front of him. His expression is calm, so it's not anything wild like a group of rabbits ritualistically sacrificing a sparrow. More like he's seen a piece of cheese, and the abbot can't quite recall when last he had cheese. Later, idly, he'll pick it up and realize that it's lint from his socks.

🗃️🧪","Meme. Medieval colored drawing showing a figure in a small boat with a large green fish attached to his head. The figure is likely a man, but this is uncertain. His name is even less certain, but we'll call him Yedward. He is wearing a long orange shirt, and is paddling his boat across a body of blue water. There are clouds int eh background. Yedward might have been wearing a hat at some point, but if he was, the fish has eaten it. He seems very concerned, and you would too. That fish is no joke.

The fish has it's jaws around Yedward's head, and is arching its back so far that its tail will soon touch the top of its head. It's fins are thrust out, and it looks very graceful.

It's unfair to name the man but not the fish, so we'll call her Merwena. She was raised on tales of Jonah & Moby Dick, & longs to be like her literary heroes. She's going to eat this man if it takes all day. He can't paddle forever. Especially with a hole in his head.

You can only see the top of his head; his nose is buried in the green felt of the table. There are several sets of cards in front of him, and a small pile of chips. The man is wearing a white dress shirt and what looks like a black vest. He does not seem to be wearing a watch, is is always a terrible mistake in a casino.

The man's fingers are spread across his head, and you can be sure that he has betided some woe. It also looks a bit like he's pulling his head off and putting it into the pot. All in means *all* in.

The man's hair is short, and you can see the edges of his ears. They seem like very fine ears, and not the ears of a looser. He should take heart in this; if nothing else -- like Prince Humperdinck -- he will be able to walk away with his ears intact.

Much love.","This message is for those who had a lot to lose with this election, and for those with empathy. There’s hurt, there’s embarrassment, there’s fear, and there’s so much more. 

There will be a lot of time for messages of hope, unity, protection and support as we move forward. Right now, it’s all about feeling.

Everyone needs that room. Everyone needs that moment to let feelings exist, and that moment to acknowledge them for what they are.

You’re allowed to feel. You’re allowed to fear. You’re allowed to worry about your friends, family, or anyone who may be impacted by changes in laws and policy to come.

I’m not going to sit here and convince anyone that they need to change how they’re feeling. I’m not going to say that everything will be “fine” for education, healthcare, gender equality or other important issues under the impending administration.

My only request is to remain rational, to remain as healthy as possible, and to frankly keep breathing. 

We’re all tired. We know how hard it is to work for a better future. We just… can’t let go of that dream.

We can’t let go of that better future for all.

We’ll talk again soon. I’ll always want to do everything possible to help communities in need, to push for that better future for you and everyone around… but even I need that time to feel right now. As do you.

convey that everything ends up fine in the end. There is no solace in rearranging language to make a different word tell the same lie. Sometimes the moral arc of the universe

does not bend in a direction that will comfort us, Sometimes in bends in ways we don't expect & there are people who fall off in the process. Please, dear reader,

do not say I am hopeless, I believe there is a better future to fight for, 1 simply accept the possibility that I may not live to see it. Thave grown weary of telling myself lies

You get very flustered when you realize your friend still wears diapers, and even more so when you find out her dad is handling all the diaper changes. Immediately, for a reason you cannot figure out, an image flashes in your mind, just for a moment, of you in her place, laying on your back with your legs up, obidiently waiting for him to put a diaper on you like a baby. But that moment has overtaken all your other thoughts, to the point where you might not be very reasonable anymore.

So, without thinking very clearly about it, you imagine a sequence of events. And it starts with you having a very unfortunate, embarassing, and humiliating accident: and before you've decided to go for it, you wet yourself. Part of you is wondering just what it is you're doing, but mostly you're focused on the warmth spreading through your leggings, imaging, hoping, wanting for it not to be the biggest rush you'll feel tonight.

You move on to Phase Two immediately, which is probably the most difficult. And before you lose your nerve, you nervously tap a door three times, and hesitantly open it. This part does not need any acting on your end, your heart is racing, beating faster and faster as you're squirming in your drenched clothes... stuttering that you've had an accident. Too late to turn back now.

“Brian Thompson went from Jewell, Iowa (population 1,200) to leading 140,000 employees and overseeing $280B of revenue at one of the world’s most important companies. His mom worked as a beautician, his dad at a grain elevator—they were probably really proud when he graduated valedictorian of his 50-person high school class. He played basketball and the trombone, got elected homecoming king, and worked in soybean fields and meat processing plants during summers. While studying at the University of Iowa, he met the woman who would become his wife, with whom he would have two kids.

survive to see the confetti fall from the sky, those who

did not live to watch the parade roll down the street.
I have grown accustomed to a lifetime of aphorisms
meant to assuage my fears, pithy sayings meant to

convey that everything ends up fine in the end. There is no
solace in rearranging language to make a different word
tell the same lie. Sometimes the moral arc of the universe

does not bend in a direction that will comfort us.
Sometimes it bends in ways we don’t expect & there are
people who fall off in the process. Please, dear reader,

do not say I am hopeless, I believe there is a better future
to fight for, I simply accept the possibility that I may not
live to see it. I have grown weary of telling myself lies

that I might one day begin to believe. We are not all left
standing after the war has ended. Some of us have
become ghosts by the time the dust has settled.",https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:7ed4maebduqsw6qfrw46327q/bafkreifywiuo53wycifevtjt7fci52bwdqc7zrjek3eqmufkczgiyf3nkm@jpeg,384,145,2,2025-01-20T21:35:31.863Z,2025-01-20T21:35:32.853Z,https://bsky.app/profile/skudiklier.bsky.social/post/3lg7c75hkbc2h,2025-12-09 10:51:02

ohjoysextoy.com/eatpussy","How to Eat Pussy by Erika Moen and Matthew Nolan. Originally published March 25, 2014 on https://www.ohjoysextoy.com/eatpussy


This comic is drawn in a cartoony style with a palette limited to black, white, and several shades of pink. Erika Moen is a cis white woman with short pink hair. She wears a striped short-sleeved shirt, black skirt, black tights, and big chunky boots. Jay, a Masturbateer, is an east-asian trans masculine nude person with top surgery scars and facial and body hair. 

Page 1
Sitting on an enormous undersea vulva-like shell like a throne, Erika holds half an oyster shell in one hand as she winks and greets the reader with, ""Oh boy, Perverts, I'm so excited for today's topic...""

""How to Eat Pussy"" is spelled out in an elegant cursive across the rest of the oversize sea shells that sit in the background. 

Leaning in from the side of the panel, Jay asks, ""Ahk, Erika, must you be crass? Its proper name is Cunnilingus!""

Erika sucks down the oyster from the shell in her hand with a 'slrp!'

""Cunnilingus?"" Erika turns to face Jay with a giant smile and holds her hand up for an expected high five. ""More FUNnilingus, amirite?""

Leaving her hand hanging mid-air, Jay states, ""I'm not high-fiving you for that."" 

To the audience, Erika explains with the now-empty oyster shell still in hand, ""I'm afraid we'll have to keep this to a basic introduction. It's such a vast topic and I've only got so much space! First of all, you should get to know what you're about to bury your face in.""

allthingsd.com/20090709/sir... - you're telling me Elon talked about it before 2009?
Or 2011? www.beet.tv/2011/07/allt...","Musk was the earliest person to talk to me about artificial intelligence. A.I. has been around forever, but he was really concerned about the impact of A.I. on humanity. That was another thing. He was the first person to raise those alarms, to me at least, when he started OpenAI with Sam Altman and the rest of them.
First he was like: A.I. is going to kill us. The Terminator idea, right? It’s going to become self-aware, and then it’s going to turn around and bomb us and kill us and start again. And we’ve got to stop that. That was his theory.
Next time I saw him, he came up with a much more sophisticated idea of it, which was: They’re not going to kill us. They’re going to treat us like house cats. They’re fine with us here, and they’re going to build everything around us. But we’re not in danger. As long as they like house cats, we’re fine. They don’t think of us as anything more.
Then the next time I saw him, he had evolved into this idea that A.I. was more like building highways — the way we build highways across the country. Humanity is a bunch of anthills. And we go across anthills without thinking when we’re building roads. We don’t know that the anthills are there. We just do it.
And I thought he was expressing how he operates: These things are anthills. I don’t have to think about them, because we never think about them. To me, that was a really interesting progression: The first one cares about what happens to humanity, and the last one doesn’t.

Foundation simulation models that can be fine-tuned to experimental free energy data to produce systematically more accurate predictions.","Figure 1 from arXiv preprint https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.06.631610

Fig. 1 Espaloma is an end-to-end differentiable molecular mechanics parameter assignment scheme for arbitrary organic molecules. Espaloma (extensible surrogate potential optimized by message-passing) is a modular approach for directly computing molecular mechanics force field parameters FFF from a chemical graph G such as a small molecule or biopolymer via a process that is fully differentiable in the model parameters FNN. In Stage 1, a graph neural network is used to generate continuous latent atom embeddings describing local chemical environments from the chemical graph. In Stage 2, these atom embeddings are transformed into feature vectors that preserve appropriate symmetries for atom, bond, angle, and proper/improper torsion inference via Janossy pooling.54 In Stage 3, molecular mechanics parameters are directly predicted from these feature vectors using feed-forward neural networks. This parameter assignment process is performed once per molecular species, allowing the potential energy to be rapidly computed using standard molecular mechanics or molecular dynamics frameworks thereafter. The collection of parameters FNN describing the espaloma model can be considered as the equivalent complete specification of a traditional molecular mechanics force field such as GAFF38,39/AM1-BCC55,56 in that it encodes the equivalent of traditional typing rules, parameter assignment tables, and even partial charge models.

“People are questioning whether the capex spent on AI has been worth it, so if we see tangible results and monetization from Salesforce, that could suggest tech deserves its premiums. If it’s a bad print, that will be disappointing since so much growth has already been baked in.”

Then, randomly he will bring up that he's been listening to some Christian podcast and he'll start off by saying that it explains how Christian men need to act and I'll listen and say great, that's some good stuff and he'll take that cue to start talking about how Christian women need to act.

Since people confuse hope and (toxic) optimism:  www.resilience.org/stories/2023...,"I always feel it’s very important to clear up the distinction between hope and optimism. For me, optimism is a form of certainty: everything will be fine, therefore, nothing is required of us, which is really the same as cynicism and pessimism and despair. Hope, for me, is just recognizing that the future is being decided to some extent in the present, and what we do matters because of that reality.

I think the fundamental role of imagination and hope is just the ability to imagine a world that’s different from what it is now. [Writer] Adrienne Maree Brown once said that all organizing is science fiction because you’re imagining something that doesn’t exist yet. But of course, it’s like, what is it that you’re imagining? I find that so many people around me are very good at imagining everything falling apart, everything getting worse; they’re good at dystopia, they’re bad at utopia.",https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:ya7gfadgypyypiva5pboi6mi/bafkreiao5tu4y2dcxjpfitkyrskark727qdwqr5rwkobwdef4xmasrlwwm@jpeg,114,23,1,2025-03-26T19:27:40.280Z,2025-03-26T19:26:37.798Z,https://bsky.app/profile/rebeccasolnit.bsky.social/post/3llcjeea4222c,2025-12-09 10:56:48

CARD GAME WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP CONVENTION HALL. We see a younger AGATHA, our titular gamer mom, receiving a grand world champ trophy from an EMCEE IN A SUIT. She is about 15 or 16, dressed kind of like Yu-Gi-Oh himself. Black, leather, gothy belts and chains. She’s hard-edged. She’s got her “gangster eyes” on.
The game they play, named on banners (I can just letter ‘em later unless a cool logo strikes you) is called BATTLE TAROT

I have always seen a path to victory
stretching before me, gleaming and
warm.
PANEL 2 
Young Agatha’s in a shady roadhouse bar full of gangsters. Broken windows, busted furniture, peeling wallpaper. Tough guy central. She prepares to throw a dart while talking to a huge, scary-looking biker dude.

It was a strange childhood. I tasted loss,
but never defeat.
YOUNG AGATHA 
We playing for pink slips? I like the look of your bike.
PANEL 3
Young Agatha‘s in a grand casino and places a BATTLE TAROT card deck (again, like a normal tarot deck, but 90s) confidently on a velvet poker table. She now has a BIG SCAR over her right eye. There's crime scene tape or a chalk outline of a body behind her and she’s wearing a Sherlock Holmes deerstalker cap. 

YOUNG AGATHA (CONT’D) 
You planned a perfect crime, Santiago.
I could never prove you did it.

But if I know you, I think you’ll ante your
confession for a shot at the rarest card
ever printed.

AGATHA’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
In the present (normal colors) present-day AGATHA, THE GAMER MOM is sitting, legs crossed, at a coffee table, maybe echoing her pose from panel 3. She’s getting SHAKEN out of her memories by her bratty 7-year-old, NEVIN. A late-game Scrabble board is set up in front of her. Her cool scar has shrunken a little with age.
AGATHA is like if your mom was also a hardened gangster - tough, cool eyes that never betray surprise. JoJo protagonist eyes.
NEVIN is wide-eyed as he shakes Agatha’s arm.

FULL STORY in ALT (click on the image)","The first hotel of the trip and Milk is somehow still finding ways to make her belly bigger, she's sipping on a diet coke while her tum is gently resting on the counter of the hotel reception desk. 
""Oops sorry we're out of 4 bedroom rooms"" The receptionist said to my pal one. 
""Though, we still have two rooms available for 2 people each.""
""Great I'll share a room with Anon then"" Milk said.
Milk said. Milk said? MILK SAID?!?
""Fine by me"" ""yeah same"" Your pals agreed. Seemingly blissful to everything between you and Milk. It's just you and Milk now in the lobby ""Oh room 12 should be over there then"" Milk said casually, though her walk was anything but. Her steps had an extra kick and her tail was wagging very eagerly, as though she'd just won some kind of game. Swaying from side to side her bloated gut lead you to room 12. It's fairly dark and rustic with crooked furniture all over the place. ""ooo the beds are in here"" Milk points to a room on the right side. Two beds thankfully apart in each of your own corner, you lay down flat, hoping for the day to end. You look to your right where Milk is. DAMN! You quickly cover your eyes and say 
""oh sorry! D-didn't see you were chang- ""It's ok."" 
What? 
""You're allowed to look.""
You hesitate, and slowly remove your hand from your eyes. There she is, sitting with the biggest belly you've ever seen.  Isn't she suppose to be shy? What is actually going on??
""This is for you~"" She's got a grin and a tail that can hardly stay still.
Your jaw is on the floor. Is this a dream, maybe a cruel prank, how is any of this actually happening? ""a-eh. I-"" You can't even form a sentence, you're at a complete loss of words.
""you're cute~ We can play some more tomorrow~""
She turns off the lights. There's a sound of her hoodie hitting the ground, and the sound of her blanket covering her up.

- Nobody's sure where she comes from, she at least goes back to the 70s

- Is only about as powerful as a plush would be- in other words, don't give her sharp things and you're fine
- Currently residing at Nameless's house, constantly plotting their demise (in spite of their respawning)

He was many things but at the top of the list was a superb father. That man would go to the ends of the earth to look for the last pencil if that's what I told him our daughter needed.

He wasn't JUST the father of my child. He became my bestest friend. He was my family.

His biggest fault?

#CorruptionInSilk #photography","A nearly invisible spider web stretches between the green branches of a pine tree, backlit by warm sunlight that catches on the delicate strands, making the web shimmer like a fine net of glass. The intricate spiral pattern is precise and symmetrical, floating quietly in the foreground. Behind the web, soft bokeh blurs the outlines of sunlit rocks and forest, giving the scene a dreamlike quality. No spider is visible—just the structure it left behind.

Despite everything, they're fine.

For a few long minutes, staring at nothing, I had the feeling that everything I do is useless, irrelevant and uninteresting. That I won't be able to get to where I really want to be with all these ideas, worlds, characters or my art itself.

But fortunately, that feeling only lasted a few moments, so it's all good. I have to remember that my art has always been just an internal expression and escapism from reality, these characters and worlds keep me alive.

I would also be being unfair to the encouragement I receive from everyone around me every day, which my head tends to forget and focus more on bad thoughts.

Graphic design is not my passion so I apologize for how messy this is. These are some breakdowns of the different layer settings I like to use frequently, as well as correction layer tools.","Since the scene is very dark, I took 3 images with various light
levels. A dark base, a dim middle layer, and a bright overlight
for eye glow.

The dim layer is at the very bottom since I used the soft eraser
on the dark layer to slowly let in more light where I wanted it
(mainly on the far side of the face, closer to the window)

Then with the bright layer on top, I isolated the area around the eyes
and deleted everything else. With the soft eraser again, I slowly
brought in the glow to my preference. Since it is a separate layer
I can adjust opacity to make it lighter (important for my later edit)


Breakdown of the bright layer isolation. Due to the dark scene, I
find it is important to have the bright layer set up to create the
glow - based on my method of editing. Glow dodge and

LEYLAH FERNANDEZ: Oh, my. So the first two rounds I tried to eat healthy. I went to an Italian restaurant, Officina. It was so good. I loved their tagliatelle bolognese and then their charcuterie board too there was delicious.

But then afterwards, because I had two days off, I was, like, Okay, I can't be eating Italian for three days in a row now. We're, like, okay. It's fine, let's go to a Mexican restaurant. Luckily one of the Canadian team members that was here with Vickie told me about this great restaurant called Mi Vida. We went there before I think Jess's match. It was very good. Ate some great steak. The guacamole was amazing.

But then after Taylor's match, the physio told me I need to eat a lot of salt. I asked her, Okay, so what should I eat?

No wider cultural narrative beyond, “congratulations, you are now a joke,” a subject on which I have already expanded bitterly and thus will spare my followers further vituperative commentary, except where it becomes relevant.

From film and television I understood that the first things a trans girl must be are beautiful and passable; she must look like a cis girl and she must look stunning. This will allow her to walk invisibly through the world until such time as she is struck down, whether for humor or pathos, because even though her appearance is carefully crafted as required, original sin stains her soul: she is, was, and always will be transgender, and thus happiness is neither possible nor deserved.

I learned two lessons from this:

(1) DO NOT BE TRANSGENDER. You must be someone else. Your feelings are not, cannot be real, because if they are then you have unmade yourself, and sooner or later the world will catch on, and end you.

(2) IF YOU MUST BE TRANSGENDER, BE ASHAMED. Do not aspire to be someone. Cast aside your ambition. Cast aside your friendships. You are a pathetic object and you must behave like one.

These are the lessons I learned from television and film. It was not enough that there were no successful trans women on screen, no role models. There were no *surviving* trans women on screen.

With much help from new friends met online I was able to unthink these lessons, to see that even though our stories are not told by anyone but ourselves we are out there, we are successful and surviving and happy and complete, and we are better off for knowing and understanding ourselves. I found myself a place in these stories and discarded as best I could the need to be beautiful and ashamed. I imagined myself ugly and obvious but still me, still a person proud to have escaped her cage.",https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:xgkr6rl3xvo7kncvva45qgwh/bafkreibznoebv46pzkqa4qw7eeyqrmdv55ovnoqjjtpczod6dkvl3himaq@jpeg,103,8,6,2025-08-09T21:36:10.065Z,2025-08-09T21:36:14.607Z,https://bsky.app/profile/badambulist.bsky.social/post/3lvypxdju4k2n,2025-12-09 11:06:42

I met a woman through some mutual friends about a year ago, and we also became friends. Last week she asked me out on a date, and I said I wasn't interested. At first she accepted my answer, but a couple days later she asked me why I wasn't interested. I felt awkward answering but decided to be honest and said I don't date Christians.

She was a little upset by my answer and asked me if I thought that was discriminatory. I said no. She said she isn't even that religious, and I said fine, but I have my own culture and religion, and Christianity tends to consume everything else. That's just my observation from some interfaith relationships I've seen.

So I upload 36 page lease for it to read for me to ask questions about. It says it’s read it, then gives wrong answers to everything in it. Because its context window is 4 words long it eventually admits it can’t see the lease anymore and asks me to re-upload. Then the garbage responses continue. I switch to Claude Sonnet 4 who has no problem.

I tell it I’m going to the dermatologist because of a mole on my arm. I send it a photo and ask it what it thinks. The guardrails go crazy, it says it’s not a doctor and gives me some general information about moles. I switch back to 4o who says that my photo doesn’t have the hallmarks of anything cancerous, gives me some options of what could be to talk to my dermatologist about. Cool. (Dermatologist agrees with 4o that I’m fine and for the reasons 4o gave actually).

I give it a lease report that was constructed by an outside contractor, and ask it to reword it into a certain format. It thinks for 8 minutes, and then only mildly adheres to the format I set at best, and some sentences are no longer readable. I switch to Claude Sonnet 4 and it completes the task in minutes exactly as I have set out.

Am I wrong for rejecting a marriage proposal because of her GRWM (Get Ready With Me) Instagram posts?

Answers from Indian Men Only

So I recently got a marriage proposal. On paper everything looked fine - she's in Delhi, the family seemed decent, conversations went well too.

But one thing really bothered me. She's very active on Instagram, specifically the ""Get Ready With Me"" (GRWM) type of posts - you know, showing in detail every outfit, accessory, makeup step, etc. While I don't mind people being active on social media to an extent, I couldn't shake off the fact that my potential partner was basically dressing up for an online audience.",https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:w6h6dprbvdrbaidpnbjhj7yi/bafkreif2mjb7o6nfmjrcm5torjds7lgu2xycyw3267jb4xeym3mmqlvjiy@jpeg,191,6,16,2025-08-27T22:47:01.000Z,2025-08-27T22:47:05.514Z,https://bsky.app/profile/askaubry.com/post/3lxg4cnx5yw2e,2025-12-09 11:07:16

Butisol (SODIUM BUTABARBITAL)

""daytime sedative"" for everyday situational stress

When stress is situational-environmental pressure, worry over illness the treatment often calls for an anxiety-allaying agent which has a prompt and predictable calming action and is remarkably well tolerated. BUTISOL SODIUM (sodium butabarbital) meets this therapeutic need.

After 30 years of clinical use... still a first choice among many physicians for dependability and economy in mild to moderate anxiety. Contraindications: Porphyria or sensitivity to

barbiturates.

Precautions: Exercise caution in moderate to severe hepatic disease. Elderly or debilitated patients may react with marked excitement or depression. Adverse Reactions: Drowsiness at daytime sedative dose levels, skin rashes, ""hangover"" and systemic disturbances are seldom seen. Warning: May be habit forming.

Usual Adult Dosage: As a daytime sedative, 15 mg. ( gr.) to 30 mg. (1 gr.) t.i.d. or q.i.d.

Critics work harder, prove themselves in detail, and fight for the good of the user. 
www.wheresyoured.at/how-to-argue...","I Am No Longer Accepting Half-Baked Arguments

If you are an AI booster, please come up with better arguments. And if you truly believe in this stuff, you should have a firmer grasp on why you do so.

It's been three years, and the best some of you have is ""it's real popular!"" or ""Uber burned a lot of money!"" Your arguments are based on what you wish were true rather than what's actually true, and it's deeply embarrassing.

Then again, there are many well-intentioned people who aren't necessarily AI boosters who repeat these arguments, regardless of how thinly-framed they are, in part because we live in a high-information, low-processing society where people tend to put great faith in people who are confident in what they say and sound smart.

I also think the media is failing on a very basic level to realize that their fear of missing out or seeming stupid is being used against them. If you don't understand something, it's likely because the person you're reading or hearing it from doesn't either. If a company makes a promise and you don't understand how they'd deliver on it, it's their job to explain how, and your job to suggest it isn't plausible in clear and defined language.

This has gone beyond simple ""objectivity"" into the realm of an outright failure of journalism. I have never seen more misinformation about the capabilities of a product in my entire career, and it's largely peddled by reporters who either don't know or have no interest in knowing what's actually possible, in part because all of their peers are saying the same nonsense.

As things begin to collapse — and they sure look like they're collapsing, but I am not making any wild claims about ""the bubble bursting"" quite yet — it will look increasingly more deranged to bluntly publish everything that these companies say.

www.wheresyoured.at/how-to-argue...","It Doesn't Matter That You Have One Use Case, That Doesn't Prove Anything

A lot of people think that they're going to tell me ""I use this all the time!"" and that'll change my mind. I cannot express enough how irrelevant it is that you have a use case, as every use case I hear is one of the following:

    I use it for brainstorming
        Who cares? Not a business model, and it's commoditized.
    I use it like search
        Who cares? It's not even good at search! It's fine! It's not even better than the low bar set by Google Search! The results it gives aren't great, and the links are deliberately made smaller, which gets in the way of me clicking them so I can actually look at the content. If you are using ChatGPT for search, you may not actually care about the content of the things you are looking at. If I'm wrong, great!
    I use it for research
        You do not respect actual research, you want a quick answer. It's that simple. These reports are slop. I've read many, many AI reports, and they are not good. Sorry!
    I use it for coding, or know someone who used it for coding
        I'll get to that in a minute.

This would all be fine and dandy if people weren't talking about this stuff as if it was changing society. None of these use cases come close to explaining why I should be impressed by generative AI.

It also doesn't matter if you yourself have kind of a useful thing that AI did for you once. We are so past the point when any of that matters.

AI is being sold as a transformational technology, and I am yet to see it transform anything. I am yet to hear one use case that truly impresses me, or even one thing that feels possible now that wasn't possible before. This isn't even me being a cynic — I'm ready to be impressed!

EXTREME ANTI-BLACK RACISM CONTENT WARNING

www.mundoamerica.com/news/2025/09...","Q. Why?

A. Until 1965, Africa was very civilized because each country was governed by a European country, and there was law and order. Look at Spain's example. Spain's history is the history of world colonization. Where Spain went, it brought order, civilization, cities... We did the same, but 500 years later. When the Europeans left, everything fell apart. Nothing remained. South Africa today is a lawless country, where even the police chief and Interpol director [Jackie Selebi] was sentenced to 15 years in prison for corruption. The African National Congress [ANC, which has governed South Africa since the end of apartheid] has looted the country. We are bankrupt. The US has cut all economic aid because South Africa supports Iran, Hamas, and all those terrorist groups. Zimbabwe, formerly Rhodesia [which also had its own apartheid], is as if it ceased to exist.

Q. Why did that happen?

A. All European countries have practiced racial discrimination. What happened is that South Africa maintained it when it achieved full independence in 1961. So apartheid is not something South Africa invented but something it continued. For example, the Netherlands did not allow people of color to enter its territory until 1920, despite having colonies in countries with people of color. South Africa maintained apartheid for an obvious reason: as soon as European countries left Africa, everything went to hell, civilization ended.",https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:yn75hmwkitdshnylue6d3grk/bafkreieezpkvcwpx7xi7gta4m335mmpmublgsbnutphytt3fx5bfsykbpy@jpeg,1765,611,62,2025-09-15T01:21:53.720Z,2025-09-15T01:22:00.006Z,https://bsky.app/profile/niedermeyer.online/post/3lytne4ein22g,2025-12-09 11:08:44

AlTA for reporting my fiancé missing after he went out at 10pm for deodorant and disappeared for 7 hours?

My (30F) fiancé (33M) went out on Saturday night to the store for a couple things he needed (l.e. deodorant) around 10pm while I stayed home with our kid (2F). He told me he was making a quick run to the store and would be right back.

He borrowed my car and left and I thought nothing of it. Fast forward to midnight and he's still not back. I sent him texts and called but he didn't answer. At 1am I got really worried and called my mom to come help me search for him while I had my sister look after our kid.

The ICE facility in Portland has been subject to months of dangerously chaotic protests that have put residents and federal agents in harm's way.
The governor's assertion that there is no national security threat and the mayor's assertion that everything is fine is tone-deaf.
It's shameful that state and local leaders have allowed violent mobs and domestic terrorists to assault federal law enforcement, destroy property, and interfere with those seeking immigration services from obtaining assistance and case management.
We need order, we need to restore safety, and Oregon's local leaders have failed to provide it.

should not come as tough or surprising. Like some of you last night, I watched the documentary, ""A Precarious State"", noting the presence of former KARE-TV reporter Rick Kupchella, its unusual commercial-free runtime on several ABC stations owned by the Hubbard family and its weighted cast of landlords, ""business leaders"" and
conservatives of varying pedigrees. Being a guy who doesn't get out much, I had no inkling of the production until yesterday morning, when I read an infomercial on the Star Tribune's op-ed page. It was a piece written by Kupchella touting his show. I could have thought, ""Cool! The Strib is now running paid promos in its editorial
section. Kind of like Budweiser decals on Nascars."" I hadn't stopped asking, ""What the f*ck is this? before several texts arrived asking if I knew
anything about the show."" Several of my woke, Marxist, anti-capitalist, eat-the-rich, let's all eat bugs-and-roots cronies were already smelling a new variation of a MAGA-marinated Liz Collin/Mrs. Bob Kroll attack on the faerie
lefty nymphs running Minneapolis... or in the case of Kupchella's piece, all of Minnesota. Not knowing anything about what was up, I told them that I only knew Kupchella from back in the
day and generally liked his work. As they say in the biz, ""He's good TV."" Not a raver. Not a ranter.
Adept at compiling statistics and delivering the goods with a genial, neighborly vibe. To a couple of my pals I did add, somewhat recklessly, that he was also ""a relentless self- promoter"", ""relentless"" probably being a bit much. But the point was the guy, even as a staff reporter for a corporate-owned TV station knew how to market his goods.

What's so difficult to grasp about I DONT WANT THEM
Join
..•
RANT
I (29F) am the most staunchly CF person most people in my life will ever meet. I am VERY vocal about how I hate kids and see them as tools for the patriarchy only, how I consider pregnancy and childbirth domestic violence and how I pity every single pregnant woman/mom in existence, no matter how badly they thought or think they want that. How I believe that you can't love someone a woman and claim to want children from her, because why would you do that to someone you love? How I wholeheartedly do not care if we go extinct because the human species is surviving at the expense of women and always did, and how fetuses are growing tumors to me because they have the same potential for harming me if not more. How in an ideal world we would have separate CF everything (not just transport and restaurants, straight up separate city areas and if I never run into another kid again it will be too soon. I had to end the relationship with what would have otherwise been the live of my life because he, too, wanted to fucking breed. Every single interaction I am forced to have with kids is awkward and unpleasant for all parts involved.
So, you'd think people would get that I'm NOT HAVING ANY FUCKING KIDS EVER, right? Apparently not! Apparently one guy in my friend group (not the closest to me, but very tight knit as a group and has witnessed all of the above multiple times) thought it was circumstances-dependant, the same way he is only open to having them if he ever makes enough

It was appalling. Most people don’t know that more people died from COVID under Biden than under Trump, because Biden essentially came in and said, “COVID’s over. Everybody get back to work.” After all the moralizing from the media in the early days of COVID, under Biden everything was suddenly fine. “Actually, ignore everything that we just told you last year.” The mainstream media was, in my view, actively pushing dangerous misinformation, misleading people into believing COVID had disappeared, even though doctors treating patients warned that we were still in a raging pandemic with fewer available treatments.

Sorry Gale, your freak just doesn't match Aldiirn's, who failed on Insight and is now fairly convinced he stumbled on a topsider taboo. #art","This certainly isn't what Astarion expects. Curious, he prods, ""You and Gale always look like peas in a pod together. Wouldn't you want to have a long hard magic lesson with him?

""Shadows, no!"" Aldiirn blurts out. ""I thought we were getting along fine! Maybe we could be mates sometime. Friend mates,"" he makes clear, though the Under-accent coming through says it well enough. ""Then I find out he already fancies us more.""

""What am I to do now?"" Aldiirn turns to Astarion in utter bewilderment and distress. ""Gale is a client with a pending review. If I make him cross all those points will be bound for the abyss! And I can't dump him when his last ex is telling him to explode himself!""

Wouldn't that be wonderful, Astarion thinks to himself and tries not to smile too much. Exploding Gale aside, this is almost too good, but he has to be sure. ""You can't have been completely unaware of Gale's yearning all this time. Surely there's a mote of affection, a feeling from you he's clung to?""

""Maybe,"" Aldiirn hums evasively, ""When we had the tieflings at camp.""

Astarion leans in. It's so amusing to watch Aldiirn when he's without his courier-perfect persona.

Not the A-hole

I recently hosted a dinner party for my friends and I allowed them to bring their significant others and plus ones. One of my best friends of many years brought her boyfriend whom I have never met until now. During said party, her boyfriend wanted to show off his ability to do a handstand, effectively knocking into one of my tables and shattering a lot of expensive pottery and glassware. No one was hurt but everything was shattered beyond repair.

Transcript

Panel 1

Iris is busy working when August pops into her office.

August: IRIS! I need a favor.

Iris: You're not supposed to be here today.

Panel 2

August looks a little desperate and seems to be in a real bind. Iris knows he wouldn't ask for help unless he truly needs it.

August: I was called in for an emergency. I need help and you're the only one I trust.

Iris: Fine.

Panel 3

August has left his son, Gustopher. Iris regrets everything. Gustopher is looking around with curiosity. There's not a whole lot to see. In the back is a poster with an angry cat hanging onto a rope. The the poster says ""HANG IN THERE AND GET REVENGE"".

Panel 4

Gustopher decides to ask an important question.

Gustopher: Does your phone have games?

Iris: Yes.
